            comparable to athletic events such as running a marathon. I believe the physical demands of
            giving birth deserves more than a “one-size fits all” approach to exercise. As a certified pre/post
            natal performance training specialist, I am here to support your motherhood journey with safe,
            effective, and scientifically proven evidence-based programming designed specifically for you
            and your body’s ever-changing needs during this time."
